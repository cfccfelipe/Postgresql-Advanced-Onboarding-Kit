# ‚öôÔ∏è Performance & Integrity ‚Äì ProjectPulse

This document outlines the performance, integrity, and access strategies applied to the ProjectPulse PostgreSQL schema. It includes indexing, DBMS tuning, constraints, partitioning, and materialized views to support scalable collaboration and onboarding clarity.

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Indexes

**Purpose**:
Accelerate query performance and support frequent access patterns.

**Index Coverage**:
- `documents`: by `project_id` and `uploaded_at` for timeline queries
- `project_tag`: by `project_id` for tag filtering
- `projects`: by `owner_id`, `phase_id`, `priority_id`, `license_id`
- `project_tech_stack`: by `tech_id` for stack filtering
- `project_feature`: by `feature_id` for capability mapping

**Traceability**:
- Use `pg_indexes`, `EXPLAIN`, and `pg_stat_user_indexes` to validate coverage
- Monitor index usage and bloat for maintenance

---

## ‚úÖ Step 2: DBMS Performance Configuration

**Purpose**:
Tune PostgreSQL for update-heavy workloads, parallelism, and large field storage.

**Optimizations**:
- `fillfactor`: applied to `documents` and `projects` to reduce page splits
- `parallel_workers`: enabled for both tables to support parallel scans
- `toast_tuple_target`: increased for large JSONB fields (`settings`, `endpoints`, `custom_properties`)
- `STORAGE EXTENDED`: applied to long text fields like `filetype_reference.description`

**Traceability**:
- Monitor with `pg_settings`, `pg_stat_bgwriter`, and `pg_stat_user_tables`
- Document tuning rationale in `dbms-config-notes.md`

---

## ‚úÖ Step 3: Constraints and Validation

**Purpose**:
Enforce business rules and data integrity across critical tables.

**Examples**:
- `users`: valid email format, non-empty passwords, lowercase logins
- `documents`: non-empty `filename`, positive `version`
- `projects`: non-empty `title`, positive `version`
- `project_decision_log`: non-empty `summary`

**Traceability**:
- Use `pg_constraint`, `pg_class`, and CI/CD test cases
- Document constraint rationale in `constraint-notes.md`

---

## ‚úÖ Step 4: Partitioning Strategy

**Purpose**:
Improve scalability and query performance for large tables.

**Implemented**:
- `projects`: partitioned by `priority_id` using LIST strategy
- `documents`: partitioned by `priority_id` using LIST strategy

**Future**:
- `documents`: projected RANGE partitioning by `uploaded_at` for time-based slicing
- Monthly partitions ready for activation

**Traceability**:
- Inspect structure via `pg_inherits` and `pg_partitioned_table`
- Automate rotation with triggers or scheduled jobs
- Document logic in `partitioning-strategy.md`

---

## ‚úÖ Step 5: Materialized Views for Optimized Access

**Purpose**:
Precompute and cache frequently accessed data for dashboards and onboarding.

**Views**:
- `matview_project_summary`: project metadata with owner, phase, priority, license
- `matview_document_metadata`: document metadata with filetype and storage
- `matview_project_tags`: semantic tags per project
- `matview_project_feature_matrix`: features per project
- `matview_project_tech_stack`: tech stack per project

**Traceability**:
- Use `pg_matviews` and `pg_views` to inspect definitions
- Refresh manually or via scheduled jobs
- Version views in Git for schema evolution
