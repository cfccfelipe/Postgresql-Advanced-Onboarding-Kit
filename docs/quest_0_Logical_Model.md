# 🧩 Logical Modeling & Normalization – ProjectPulse ER Model

This document outlines the logical modeling and normalization process used to design the ProjectPulse PostgreSQL schema. It begins with business rule extraction and conceptual modeling, then applies normalization and table generation to support onboarding clarity and semantic traceability.

---

## ✅ Step 0: Logical Modeling & Business Rule Definition

**Purpose**
Capture the domain logic, entities, and relationships that define the ProjectPulse platform before physical implementation.

**Approach**
- Identified core business processes: project tracking, document management, decision logging
- Defined entity responsibilities and relationships based on real-world workflows
- Focused on semantic clarity, modularity, and traceability across all interactions

**Business Rules Captured**
- A user can own and update multiple projects
- Projects can have multiple documents, tags, features, and tech stacks
- Decisions must be logged with type, author, and timestamp
- Semantic metadata (tags, features, tech) must be reusable and normalized
- All entities must support soft deletes and versioning

**Traceability**
- Captured in early ER sketches and domain walkthroughs
- Validated with onboarding scenarios
- Served as the foundation for normalization and schema generation

---

## ✅ Step 1: Core Entity Identification

**Purpose**
Define the foundational entities and relationships that drive collaboration and document tracking.

**Core Entities**
- `USERS`: contributors, editors, and owners
- `PROJECTS`: central unit of work
- `DOCUMENTS`: attached files and metadata
- `PROJECT_DECISION_LOG`: decisions and rationale
- `SESSIONS`: user activity tracking

**Relationship Mapping**
- Users update projects and make decisions
- Projects include documents, tags, features, tech stacks, and decisions
- Documents are typed and stored
- Semantic metadata is linked via reference tables

**Traceability**
- Modeled using Mermaid ER diagram (see final section)
- Validated against onboarding and semantic tagging needs

---

## ✅ Step 2: Normalization Strategy

**Purpose**
Ensure data integrity, eliminate redundancy, and support scalable querying.

**Normalization Applied**
- **1NF**: atomic fields, no repeating groups
- **2NF**: removed partial dependencies (e.g., project metadata split from tags/features)
- **3NF**: removed transitive dependencies (e.g., license and priority abstracted into lookup tables)

**Examples**
- `PROJECTS` references `license_id`, `priority_id`, `phase_id` instead of raw strings
- Bridge tables (`PROJECT_TAG`, `PROJECT_FEATURE`, `PROJECT_TECH_STACK`) support many-to-many relationships
- `DOCUMENTS` normalized to separate metadata from filetype and storage references

**Traceability**
- Normalization steps documented in `docs/schema-normalization.md`
- Reviewed via onboarding walkthroughs

---

## ✅ Step 3: Table Generation

**Purpose**
Translate the normalized model into PostgreSQL tables with constraints, indexes, and semantic clarity.

**Mechanism**
- Tables created via SQL scripts in `src/sql/schema/`
- Primary and foreign keys enforced
- Fields (`created_at`, `updated_at`, `version`, `deleted_at`) included across all core tables
- JSONB fields used for flexible metadata (`settings`, `endpoints`, `custom_properties`)

**Examples**
- `PROJECTS`: includes semantic references and ownership metadata
- `DOCUMENTS`: includes file metadata, semantic typing, and storage references
- `PROJECT_DECISION_LOG`: links decisions to users and projects

**Traceability**
- Scripts versioned in Git
- ER diagrams updated in `docs/diagrams/`
- Validated via test data and CI/CD coverage

---

## ✅ Step 4: Semantic Tagging & Reference Integrity

**Purpose**
Enable flexible querying and onboarding clarity.

**Mechanism**
- Bridge tables link projects to semantic metadata
- Reference tables (`LICENSE_REFERENCE`, `PRIORITY_REFERENCE`, etc.) enforce controlled vocabularies
- Materialized views planned for onboarding dashboards

**Traceability**
- Tags defined in `docs/taxonomy/`
- Views tracked in `src/sql/views/`
- Linked to onboarding scripts and test cases

---

## ✅ Step 5: Entity Relationship Diagram

**Purpose**
Visualize the normalized schema and its relationships for onboarding and semantic navigation.
