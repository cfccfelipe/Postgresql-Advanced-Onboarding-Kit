# 🧠 Practice Scenario: CookSync – A Scalable Recipe Collaboration Platform

In this lab, you'll put PostgreSQL best practices into action to build high-quality, maintainable databases step-by-step.

## 🎯 Objective
Design, implement, and optimize a PostgreSQL database for **CookSync**, a collaborative cooking platform where users can:

- Create, edit, and share recipes
- Track cooking sessions
- Audit changes and version history

The system must support:

- ✅ Concurrent edits
- ✅ Secure, role-based access
- ✅ Structured and semi-structured data (JSON)
- ✅ Performance at scale (partitioning, indexing, materialized views)
