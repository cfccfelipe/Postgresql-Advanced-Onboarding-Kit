# 🧠 Practice Scenario: ProjectPulse – Scalable Project Collaboration Platform

## 🧭 Purpose
In this lab, you'll put PostgreSQL best practices into action to build high-quality, maintainable databases step-by-step.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
Build and optimize a PostgreSQL schema that supports:

- 👥 Multi-user collaboration on projects
- 📝 Version history and audit trails
- 🔐 Role-based access control (RBAC)
- 🧩 Structured and semi-structured data (JSON)
- 🚀 Performance at scale (partitioning, indexing, materialized views)

## 🧱 System Overview
**ProjectPulse** enables users to:

- Create, edit, and share project profiles
- Attach and manage project documents
- Track work sessions and outcomes
- Audit changes and version history
- Collaborate securely with differentiated permissions (owner vs participant)
